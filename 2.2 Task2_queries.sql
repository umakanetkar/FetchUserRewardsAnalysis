SELECT distinct(rewardsReceiptStatus) , count(*)

-- we do not have 'accepted' as a rewardsReceiptStatus but we will consider the 'finished' cases as 'accepted ones' 
-- this could be a wrong assumption because finished could actually means the receipts that have been fully processed the 
-- outcome of which can be REJECTED or SUCCESSFUL - this ambiguity is a data quality issue
-- We are taking 'sum' of purchasedItemCount to get a total of number of items purchased

-- The total spent and total items purchased for 'finished'/ 'accepted' is more - this could be because of an uneven 
-- distribution between both classes, more analysis and information is required for a definite conclusion


-- Q. Which brand has the most spend among users who were created within the past 6 months?

-- Logic: Get max(createDate) and retrive user.id made 6 months from that date, match the user.id with receipts.userIds
-- and get hold of receipts.id and then ultimately reach rewardItems.finalPrice and rewardItems.quantityPurchased to 
-- calculate the total spent

-- Ans: The brand is Cracker Barrel Cheese with a total spend of 4080$.

-- Q. Which brand has the most transactions among users who were created within the past 6 months?

-- to get the brand with most number of transactions, we have to count the number of times that brand is mentioned
select brands.name, count(*) as number_of_transactions
